My BCIT Technical Web Developer Portfolio Site

Disclaimer: I am not much of an artist so i focus on the functionality.

This is my portfolio site, developed using HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, Gulp.

At the moment I would say its near completion, few bugs on mobile devices that need to be worked out and a few styling elements that i can work on.
